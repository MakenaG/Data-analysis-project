## 🧹 Data Cleaning (SQL Server)
**Main cleaning steps performed in SSMS:**
- Removed blank rows and incomplete records.
- Standardized text formatting for key columns (`Category`, `Country`, `ContractTypes`).
- Dropped salary columns with too many missing or inconsistent entries.
- Verified column data types (ensuring text, dates, and numbers were properly typed).
- Exported the final cleaned dataset to Excel using:
  ```sql
  SELECT * 
  INTO JobsCleaned
